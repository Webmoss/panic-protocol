@dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP-712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.\n The encoding scheme specified in the EIP requires a domain separator and a hash

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to\n produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.\n This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding\n scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA\n ({_hashTypedDataV4}).\n The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating\n the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.\n NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \"v4\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method\n https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].\n NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain\n separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the {_domainSeparatorV4} function to always rebuild the\n separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage.\n

@dev Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number in Z/nZ.\n If n is a prime, then Z/nZ is a field. In that case all elements are inversible, except 0.\n If n is not a prime, then Z/nZ is not a field, and some elements might not be inversible.\n If the input value is not inversible, 0 is returned.\n NOTE: If you know for sure that n is (big) a prime, it may be cheaper to use Fermat's little theorem and get the\n inverse using `Math.modExp(a, n - 2, n)`.

Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding they need in order to produce the hash of their typed data using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`. This contract implements the EIP-712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA ({_hashTypedDataV4}). The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain. NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \\\"v4\\\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask]. NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain separator of the implementation contract.
